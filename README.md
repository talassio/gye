## gh-pages: website

A "build failing" for the gh-pages branch could simply mean broken links were found.

To test the website locally, install [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) and run:

```bash
jekyll serve --baseurl ''
```

To test links, install html-proofer (`sudo gem install html-proofer`) and run:

```bash
jekyll serve --baseurl ''
# Ctrl-C to stop
htmlproof ./_site
```
